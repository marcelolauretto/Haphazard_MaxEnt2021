This repository contains the R scripts implemented for the numerical experiments conducted in the work 

Miguel M, Waissman R, Lauretto M, Stern J, "Survey Optimization via the Haphazard Intentional Sampling Method", 

presented in the 40th International Workshop on Bayesian Inference and Maximum Entropy Methods in Science and Engineering (MaxEnt2021) and under revision for publication.

The file HIS.zip contains the scripts with implementations for the Haphazard Intentional Sampling, Rerandomization and Pure Random Sampling methods. 
The main script is Driver_HH_RR.R, which invokes all other scripts.
